Configure a proper environment to play wih Web3, debug and audits smart contracts can be a pain at the beginning.

The purpose of this post is to rough out the tools to keep only the most interesting.

# solc
Solc is a compiler for the Solidity language. It transform the Solidity code into a bytecode.

# abigen

# Foundry
**Founrdry** defined themself as:
> Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
It's a swiss army knife for Ethereum application. It allows to fork the blockchain, deploy smart contract, directly call the smart contracts and more.

It is composed of three tools:
- [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/forge): Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and Dapptools).
- [Cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/cast): Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- [Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/anvil): Used to fork the blockchain and run a local node like Ganache or Hardhat.

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#Installation)

It is on of the most complete tool for auditing and developping smart contracts.

# Hardhat

# Remix

# Truffle

# Setup


_This post will be updated when new tools that can improve the environment are published_
